# PIClassifier
PIClassifier: automatic classifier for the Muttini et al (2014) research. Classify the input breath curves in three classes and allow to understand if the P/I ratio is high enough.

The problem to solve was a ternary classi cation -- Yes, No, Maybe -- of signals generated by the activity of the diaphragm during a registration of five minutes. This work is a part of a bigger research [1] lead by Dr. Giorgio Villani.

A [report](https://github.com/Emanz93/PIClassifier/blob/master/Technical_Report.pdf)  has been wrote to explain the inner algorithm and implementation choices.
